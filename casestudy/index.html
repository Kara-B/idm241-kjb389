            This case study discusses the process I went through when creating a simple microinteraction and eventually a complex one for my microinteraction class. I was introduced to microinteractions and their structure, and had to apply what I already knew how to do in code to create my own microinteraction and build on it throughout the course. I talk about the design choices I made and the steps I took to successfully code what I had planned to do for my microinteractions. For the final project, I was able to code my own complex microinteraction using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Javascript.
